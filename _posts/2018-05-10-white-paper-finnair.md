This paper will focus on Japan where is promising Finnair a competitive and profitable market. Through previous campaigns launched in this market, Finnair gave out the idea based on available sources such as Moomins, Merimekko or brand ambassadors to en- gage their target customers in the brand. However, the engagement might stop at the lev- el of “awareness” or “recognition”, however, what Finnair should expect is the advocate and the memorable event with the brand. Alistair Williams (2006) confirmed that innova- tion design will display a call to action and convey the brand message effectively. Innova- tion design can be physical or mental approach to customers. As a result, it is no doubt to see storytelling will boost memorability of the brand (Mossberg and Nissen Johansen, 2006), at the same time, to maximize the effectiveness of this technique, a story should contain the surprising factor. On the other hand, an idea needs to count the cultural com- ponent to create the strong connection with customers so that they can perceive the mes- sage easier and deeper. Data, in most cases, is the best reference to see the past and expect the future, simultaneously, measure the effectiveness of the campaign.

The whitepaper will briefly analyze the shortage of previous campaigns launched in Japan market, collect theoretical background then propose recommendations so that Finnair can improve and innovate the next campaigns in Japan.
