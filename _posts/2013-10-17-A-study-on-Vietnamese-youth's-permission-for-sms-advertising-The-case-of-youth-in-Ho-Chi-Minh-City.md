**Purpose** 
The study aims to better understand customer’s views about SMS advertisements; at the same time, to examine influencers 
on permission for SMS advertising that developed in theoretical model by Bamba and Barnes (2007) and to offer recommendations and 
suggestions for SMS advertising planners.

**Design/methodology/approach** 
The study employed a triangulation approach with both qualitative and quantitative – via in-depth interviews and questionnaire deliver.

**Findings**
The results reveal that respondents surveyed respond negatively with current SMS ads in Vietnam. Text message advertisement cannot optimize 
its power and effectiveness to customers. Demographic factors such as gender and age involve insignificantly in permission. 
There are only two factors in model tested that cause impacts on customers’ permission. Attitude to SMS ads appears to have the heaviest effect 
on customers’ willingness to give permission for SMS ads. The opt-in conditions are the second important determinant which covers time of arrival, 
quantity of SMS ads and confidentiality of personal information. It also indicates most of SMS ads receivers give a high favorability for cellphone 
operator as a primary and credible advertising sender.

**Research limitations**
This paper is conducted within 4 months with limited area in Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam; a sample size of 200 respondents ranging from 18 to 35 years old 
along with unforeseen errors in the research process.

**Research implications** 
The main contribution of the paper is in furthering the existing understanding of customers’ permission as an emerging topic of SMS advertising. 
The findings and statistical evidences are provided in this paper to the area that has had little investigation so far.
